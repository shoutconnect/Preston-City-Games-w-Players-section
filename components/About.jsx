          Preston City Games returns to the UCLan Sports Arena on Friday 30th
          June 2023, from 12.00 midday. Organised by the dream team of Shout
          Connect, UCLan and Preston City Council, Preston City Games is a fun,
          one day sporting festival that pits teams of businesses and charities
          against each other in a tournament of rounders, football, netball and
          golf. Originally launched as the UK Corporate Games in 2012, the
          tournament became known as the City Games. The event is a great
          opportunity for businesses and charities to take part in a fun, but
          truly competitive, sporting event.{" "}
